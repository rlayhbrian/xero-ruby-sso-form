# Signup with Xero (Modified Flow)

> _Single Sign Up to Web Lead_

This is a basic application showing how to use OAuth2.0 and OpenID Connect flow to pre-populate a signup form.

The goal is to use Xeroâ€™s API to authorize an existing Xero customer using the supported OpenID Connect scopes which will return back the id_token to an application. Instead of dropping an interested Xero customer on a blank landing page where they have to re-enter their details and submit a signup form, they land in the context of the app partnerâ€™s existing sales process complete with the existing data contained in the id_token such as email, first_name, and last_name.

Full **Single Sign On** does not always work with an app's infrastructure or their on-boarding process might start with booking a demo, instead of immediately starting a free-trial. Because Xero leverages OA2 and OpenID Connect we can use the decoded `id_token` to prefill user details, and the `access_token` to make a few API calls the pre-populate dynamic signup details.

Using just a few lines of code, we can pre-populate the following fields from Xero's API which makes a great user experience versus dropping someone on a blank landing page.

* given_name
* family_name
* email
* org_name
* contacts_count
* currency
* timezone
* street
* city
* postal_code
* phone
* password
